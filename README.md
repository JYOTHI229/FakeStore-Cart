A **mobile-first**, fully responsive e-commerce application built with **React.js** and powered by the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). This project demonstrates my front-end skills in authentication, API integration, dynamic routing, state management using Context API, and modern React best practices — designed for internship-level demonstration.
